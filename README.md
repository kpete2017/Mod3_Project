## What To Do?
What-to-do is a web application that checks various catagories of activity (Indoor, Outdoor, Dining, Shopping) and displays on a map nearby locations for said activity. The App can then pick a random activity or sort the activities by user favorites or blacklists.

The application was built using Ruby on Rails for the back-end and HTML5 CSS3 and Javascript on the front-end.

The Google Maps, Google Places, and Google GeoLocation API's were used in the creation of this app.
